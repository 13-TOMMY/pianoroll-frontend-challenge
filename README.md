# PianoRoll Frontend Excercise

## Introduction

You will be building on top of a demo code that generates a widget for browsing Piano Rolls - the core element of [pianoroll](https://pianoroll.io).
The goal is to enhance the user interface and add an interactive component.

This is what the starting point looks like:

## Task description

### Part 1: Display

We want to implement an interface following the design similar to YouTube. There are two states we need to implement:

#### Grid layout

```
+--------------+   +--------------+   +--------------+
|              |   |              |   |              |
|  Piano Roll  |   |  Piano Roll  |   |  Piano Roll  |
|              |   |              |   |              |
+--------------+   +--------------+   +--------------+

|  Piano Roll  |   |  Piano Roll  |   |  Piano Roll  |
|              |   |              |   |              |
+--------------+   +--------------+   +--------------+
+--------------+   +--------------+   +--------------+
|              |   |              |   |              |
|  Piano Roll  |   |  Piano Roll  |   |  Piano Roll  |
|              |   |              |   |              |
+--------------+   +--------------+   +--------------+
```

#### Main View

```
+-----------------------------------+  +--------------+
|                                   |  |              |
|                                   |  |  Piano Roll  |
|                                   |  |              |
|        Main Piano Roll            |  +--------------+
|                                   |  +--------------+
|                                   |  |              |
|                                   |  |  Piano Roll  |
+-----------------------------------+  |              |
                                       +--------------+
                                             ...
```

Here are development tasks to build this interface:

1. **Implement Grid Layout**: Display the Piano Rolls in a responsive grid layout on the main page.
2. **Implement Interactive Selection**: Make each Piano Roll in the grid clickable. Upon clicking an item, it should become the main element on the page, enlarging for better visibility.
3. **List Display**: Simultaneously, display the rest of the Piano Rolls in a vertical list on the right side of the page, similar to how videos are listed on YouTubeâ€™s watch page. Ensure that the list is scrollable if there are more items than can fit on the screen.
4. **Styling**: Apply styling to make the grid and its items visually appealing. Ensure that Piano Rolls are identifiable and have a consistent size across different screen resolutions.
